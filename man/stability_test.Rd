\usage{
stability_test(
  ensemble,
  var_name = "tprate",
  ld_name = "leadtime",
  lab = var_name
)
}
\arguments{
\item{ensemble}{The UNSEEN ensemble. This function expects an dataframe with variables leadtime, precipitation.}

\item{var_name}{The column name containing the variable to be analyzed. Defaults to "tprate".}

\item{ld_name}{The column name containing the leadtimes. Defaults to "leadtime".}

\item{lab}{The label. Defaults to the variable name (var_name).}
}
\value{
a plot with the empirical return values of the pooled ensemble including confidence intervals.
Individual lead times are plotted on top.
