Description: This package provides easy evaluation and visualisation
    of the UNSEEN method. There are three tests included: The ensemble member
    independe test, the model stability test and the model fidelity test. The tests
    are designed to work on the UNSEEN ensemble generated from the SEAS5 hindcast, 
    as part of a workflow to assess extremes beyond the observed record for the 
    ECMWF Summer of Weather Code (ESoWC).
